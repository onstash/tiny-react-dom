# tiny-react-dom

`tiny-react-dom` is an implementation of `react-dom` (with a subset of features) using the official custom renderer API of react 16.

# Main purposes of the project -

* to understand what each method in the `ReconcilerConfig` object (that is passed to [`react-reconciler`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-reconciler)) does
* to implement a lightweight `react-dom`

Please create an issue for feature requests, bug fixes & alternative implementations and we will discuss it over there.
